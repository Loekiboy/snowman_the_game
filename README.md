# Snowman: The Game

**Snowman: The Game** is a fast‑paced puzzle speedrun where the goal is to get the **lowest score** by **touching as few tiles as possible** in the **shortest time**.

Levels are large and offer multiple paths, so routing is everything. Find the fastest route and keep your score minimal.
